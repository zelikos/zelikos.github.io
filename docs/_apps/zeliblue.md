Zeliblue is based off of [ublue-os/startingpoint](https://github.com/ublue-os/startingpoint), which eases the process of creating your own personalized image-based Fedora experience. For more detailed information, check out the [uBlue homepage](https://universal-blue.org/) and the [main uBlue repo](https://github.com/ublue-os/main/).

Zeliblue features the GNOME desktop as the flagship experience. Notable changes include:

- Workspace navigation shortcuts are adjusted, with the aim of being more intuitive for horizontal workspaces
- GNOME Console replaces GNOME Terminal as the default terminal, and can be launched with Super+t
- Flathub is set up in the background on first boot, both system-wide (flathub-system) and for per-user installs (flathub-user)
- GNOME Software defaults to installing apps from flathub-user
- Core system apps are installed to flathub-system after first boot
- System apps are selected based on the official [GNOME Core apps](https://apps.gnome.org/), with some substitutions and additions
- And more miscellaneous tweaks
