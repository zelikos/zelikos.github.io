In a previous blog post, [Why I Use elementary OS](/blog/posts/2019-02-03-why-i-use-elementaryos), I went over the various aspects of elementary OS that I like, and why it has become my favorite operating system to use. However, I haven't talked about why I use _Linux_. Or, more accurately, Linux-based operating systems. I'll be going over only desktop operating systems here, not mobile. <!--more-->

Let's start with why I _don't_ use other platforms. Take macOS, for instance: Not only is the whole Apple ecosystem a walled garden, their products are also fairly expensive. A Mac tends to be much more expensive than non-Apple computers with similar specs. Honestly, though, if for some reason I _had_ to choose between macOS and Windows, despite being much more familiar with the latter, I'd go with the former. Windows is just awful.

There are a _lot_ of reasons to dislike Windows, such as:

- It boots up slowly, it shuts down slowly, it updates slowly, it _runs_ slowly\*
- While technically possible to delay updates, whether your computer updates or not is ultimately up to Windows itself
- Installing software is a pain, and you have to update programs individually
- In a way, they're trying to resolve the previous point with the Windows Store, but then Windows will likely become its _own_ walled garden, much like macOS
- Pre-installed software that you may not even want to use, but can't uninstall
- It collects user data, and Microsoft has zero respect for its users' privacy
- It frequently nags about OneDrive, whether you want to use it or not
- Troubleshooting problems is just a pain

_\*while this issue is mitigated on more modern hardware, it is much more noticeable on older machines_

...but one of the biggest things for me is the desktop itself. Even despite the problems mentioned above, quite frankly, I just don't like having to _use_ the Windows desktop. I've come to really appreciate more minimal desktop environments like GNOME and Pantheon, and Windows desktop just feels overly complicated in a number of areas. For example, let's compare the Windows file explorer to elementary Files.

![The Windows file explorer, showing a slew of actions you can take with your files](https://66.media.tumblr.com/f1341751f6da57f3c28ab93f6d5d9854/tumblr_pmqlf3cnnA1rohz0jo2_1280.png)

Windows' file explorer has a lot of buttons for actions you can take, and the above picture only shows _one tab_. I don't mean to say that having more options is inherently a bad thing, but that just looks like a _mess_ to me.

![The elementary Files app, with a right-click menu active](https://66.media.tumblr.com/4fd9d6aa4faf57785021ae5b46dad92b/tumblr_pmqlf3cnnA1rohz0jo1_1280.png)

elementary Files, on the other hand, is much cleaner. Your view options are covered in the header bar, with the option of an icon grid, a list view, or column view; you can open tabs just below that, with the + (tabs being a feature that Windows' file explorer lacks entirely); actions for files and folders themselves are handled contextually in the right-click menu. All in all, a much cleaner design that remains very functional _and_ aesthetically-pleasing.

Again, I _don't_ think that having more options is inherently bad, but _presentation_ is important. In this case, less is more.

Oh, and one more thing I about the Windows file explorer: if it freezes up and you have to kill the process, it takes the rest of your desktop with it. That's not the case on _any_ Linux desktop environment I've used.

That's a rough summary of why I _don't_ use other platforms. So, why _do_ I use Linux? Well, a lot of it goes hand in hand with why I use elementary OS, which, again, you can read about [here](/blog/posts/2019-02-03-why-i-use-elementaryos).

Of course, there are plenty of things that aren't specific to elementary:

- The filesystem structure feels a _lot_ more intuitive to me than Windows' drive-letter approach
- Every Linux distro I've tried boots faster, and overall feels more responsive than Windows ever has
- While many distros do come with software pre-installed, you can uninstall whatever you like
- Software is, generally, much quicker and easier to install and update
- System updates are never forced, and are only initiated with the users' input
- Most distros _do_ respect their users' privacy, and don't do any sort of data collection
- Most distros I've used have been significantly more stable than Windows
- When issues do arise, troubleshooting is _much_ easier than on Windows
- I believe that FOSS is the best way to do software, even if I do make some exceptions (such as Discord and Steam)

Finally, and the most important to me: the freedom of choice, and control over your own computer. While I love and advocate for elementary OS, it isn't for everyone, but there are _so many_ Linux distributions to choose from, as well as desktop environments. Do you like GTK, but hate GNOME? Cinnamon and MATE are great. Do you prefer rolling releases, but want a more curated experience? Go with Solus. Do you want a system that's precisely tailored to your exact liking? Arch is ready for you. With all of the options in the Linux world, there really is something for everyone.
